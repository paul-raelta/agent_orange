# PROGRESS — Agent Orange

## Goal
Recreate the `design/` prototype as a real production app — UI + backend —
and ship something the user can run locally today, with seams in place to
lift to Cloud Run later.

## Current state — UI + backend complete; LLM stages gated on Anthropic key

**UI (`web/`)**
- Vite + React 18 + TS, React Router, TanStack Query, ThemeProvider
- All seven prototype screens ported pixel-faithfully
- New product features layered in:
  - Watchlist portfolio strip (total value / cost / unrealized P&L)
  - Per-card position line on Watchlist cards (when shares > 0)
  - Company deep-dive: AI narrative card, portfolio editor (shares + cost basis),
    new NEWS + INSIDER tabs, PLANNED tiles for future features
  - Settings: NOTIFICATIONS panel (email + phone + per-event opt-in), Providers
    simplified to Anthropic-active + OpenAI/Gemini static-planned
- Live updates via SSE on `/api/v1/events` — React Query invalidates on
  `company.updated` / `review.added`
- Production build passes (`npm run build`, 101 modules)

**Backend (`workers/`)**
- Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x async, SQLite (Postgres-portable),
  APScheduler
- 20 REST endpoints; serializer layer is the contract gate against `types.ts`
- Data model: 18 tables, all `user_id`-keyed for future multi-tenant
- Integrations live: SEC EDGAR, Finnhub (quote/news/insider), Twilio SMS
  (smoke-tested with real SMS delivery), Gmail SMTP (needs App Password to
  send), Anthropic SDK (needs API key to fire LLM stages)
- Agent pipeline: monitor → download → extract → validate → narrative → notify
  - Monitoring + discovery work today against live EDGAR (no LLM needed for
    those stages — rule-based / deterministic)
  - Extraction / validation / narrative gracefully no-op when no Anthropic key,
    log `anthropic.not_configured` and exit clean
- Scheduler running per plan §7: per-ticker daily poll, 5-min price refresh,
  30-min news/insider refresh, daily window recompute
- Notifications dispatcher wired through pipeline; user prefs per-event;
  SSE broadcast for UI live updates

## Key decisions baked in
- **GAAP vs non-GAAP EPS conflicts → always queue for review.** The SanDisk
  demo case from the prototype is the canonical demo of routing-to-review.
- **News last 30 days**, insider all Form 4s newest first.
- **Portfolio strip inline above Watchlist grid.** Keeps `screen-hd` clean.
- **SSE not websockets** for v1 live updates. Cloud Run-compatible.
- **Narrative cap 200 tokens** for the 2-3 sentence "what's worth knowing".
- **Single tsconfig** (not project references) — simpler with no real gain
  from splitting.
- **Daemon is a plain Python process** — no launchd/systemd; runs identically
  locally and on Cloud Run.

## Live data flowing right now (no LLM keys needed)
- NVDA / SNDK / MU live quotes refreshing every 5 min during market hours
- 20 news headlines + 50 insider transactions per ticker from Finnhub
- EDGAR submissions checked daily for new filings; 10-Q accession
  `0001045810-26-000052` (NVDA Q1, filed 2026-05-20) already detected

## What's left before LLM stages light up
- Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `workers/.env`
- (optional) Add `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` for the email notification channel

## Next step
Commit and push everything to `paul-raelta/agent_orange` via the existing
`github.com.paul-raelta` SSH host alias (id_rsa).
